# gamegarage

A web browser is required to view the site. This guide assumes that you already have one pre-installed on your computer. 

You will need to do the following things to get gamegarage running on your computer:

1) install python2

Python3 is not compatible with our software.

2) install the psycopg2, flask, and socketio packages for python

3) run 'git clone https://github.com/dai1313/gamegarage' to get a copy of the latest source code.

4) run the server.py file with python2 (usually 'python2 server.py'). 

5) if the server.py file runs successfully then open the hosted site in your browser.
